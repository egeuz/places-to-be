  <p>— Remember the challenge I gave you last year? You did really well, but I’m doubling down on it. Look at dad, look how healthy he looks now, follow his lead y’know?</p>
  <p>— It’s different, your dad doesn’t do anything all day</p>
  <p>— Well, now neither do you! I know you still have a lot to take care of, but you don’t have to go to work for the first time in like 400 years! Use that time to do things for yourself too, okay?</p>
